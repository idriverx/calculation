IMPORTANT:
In this task I used file_get_contents (as it is enough for current purposes), but yes, in more complex applications I'd use Guzzle

I've done the task for 1h 15mins, in other time I did small refactor (you could check it by commits ;))

You can run the script with follow:
`php app.php input.txt`

Run tests:

`./vendor/bin/phpunit tests`

Don't forget about composer install
